Stock Market Web Application - Django API + Vue Frontend


This is a Stock Market Application I created with some help from my [friend](https://github.com/te427). DESCRIPTION.
You can find a live version of the site at this address: 3.23.61.95:8080. If you want to run the application locally you will first need to clone the repo and then enter the following commands.

docker-compose run app sh -c "python manage.py makemigrations"

docker-compose run app sh -c "python manage.py add_stocks"

docker-compose up to run dev server
